Let’s assume that there is a two-dimensional plane with 𝑛 number of points represented
as (x,y). We want to connect all the points on the plane in such a way that the total distance of
connections (i.e., the summation of distances between all the connected points) is minimized. Write
an algorithm that returns the minimum total distance of all the connected points.
